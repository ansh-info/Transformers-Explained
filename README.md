# Transformer Architecture Interactive Visualization

An interactive web application built with React to help understand the Transformer architecture, its evolution, and its impact on modern AI. This project provides visual explanations of key concepts in transformer models, including self-attention mechanisms, architectural comparisons, and performance metrics.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Timeline**: Visualize the evolution of transformer architecture
- **Architecture Visualization**: Animated diagram of encoder-decoder structure
- **Self-Attention Demo**: Live visualization of attention mechanisms
- **Performance Metrics**: Compare different transformer models
- **Comparative Analysis**: RNN vs LSTM vs Transformer architecture
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

3. Add any necessary styles to Tailwind config

### Modifying Themes

Update the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Add custom colors, spacing, etc.
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
